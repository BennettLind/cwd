<p>The movie is about a famous, rookie sensation race car named Lightning Mcqueen. The movie starts with a three-way tie, whichs makes them have to travel across the country for their final race to determine the winner. </p> 


<p> On the way to the next race Mcqueen gets lost from his personal truck and finds himself in trouble with a local town called Radiator Springs.
